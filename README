NOTE for performance testing: 
If you want to test UDT's performance, please read carefully the documentation 
of UDT::setsockopt, UDT::perfmon, and the tutorial on how to tune UDT's 
performance (in ./doc directory). The example program of appserver and 
appclient may be ready for your testing (or with simple modification).

version of the software. However, you may go to the SourceForge CVS area for 
more current, but still in progress, versions. Be aware that although these 
versions will contain the most recent bug fixes to date, they have not been 
fully tested at this point.
